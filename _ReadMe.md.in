Welcome to project @PROJ_NAME@, an extension for the CMake build
management system to support the FreeBASIC (FB) programming language.
Find further information on that components at the following links

- about [CMake](http://www.cmake.org), and
- about [FreeBASIC](http://www.freebasic.net)

The package is [hosted at GitHub](@PROJ_WEBS@) and it includes

- CMake extension macros, in order to
  - check for the FB compiler and its version,
  - test the compiler,
  - declare internal CMake language variables (CMAKE_Fbc_...),
  - declare a macro to scan dependencies in FB source code, and
  - declare a function to pre-compile FB source to C source.

- the tool [cmakefbc_deps](#PagCmakeFbDeps) to
  - scan the dependency files in FB source trees and
  - integrate them in to a projects build tree.

- a CMake script and a  macro for the tool [fbdoc](http://github.com/DTJF/fbdoc) to
  - find the executable and
  - use it to build the documentation with the [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org/) generator
