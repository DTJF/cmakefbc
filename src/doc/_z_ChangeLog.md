to the project page at

Thanks go to:

- The FreeBASIC developer team for creating a great compiler.

- Bill Hoffman, Ken Martin, Brad King, Dave Cole, Alexander Neundorf,
  Clinton Stimpson for developing the \CMake tool and publishing it
  under an open licence (the documentation has optimization
  potential).
