Thanks go to:

- The FreeBASIC developer team for creating a great compiler.

- Bill Hoffman, Ken Martin, Brad King, Dave Cole, Alexander Neundorf,
  Clinton Stimpson for developing the CMake tool and publishing it
  under an open licence (the documentation has optimization
  potential).

  generate this documentation.
