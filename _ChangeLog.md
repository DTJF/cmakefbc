Thanks go to:

- The FreeBASIC developer team for creating a great compiler.

- Bill Hoffman, Ken Martin, Brad King, Dave Cole, Alexander Neundorf,
  Clinton Stimpson for developing the CMake tool and publishing it
  under an open licence (the documentation has optimization
  potential).

- Dimitri van Heesch for creating the Doxygen tool, which is used to
  generate this documentation.

- All others I forgot to mention.
