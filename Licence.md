Welcome to the package *cmakefbc*, an extension for the build
management system CMake to support the FreeBASIC (FB) programming
language. If installed in CMake, it

- checks for the FB compiler and its version,
- tests the compiler,
- declares internal CMake language variables (CMAKE_Fbc_...),
- declares a macro to scan dependencies in FB source code, and
- declares a function to pre-compile FB source to C source.
